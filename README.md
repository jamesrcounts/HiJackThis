# HiJackThis
Welcome to the HiJackThis demo repository.  I use this repository to demonstrate legacy code refactoring techniques
which I describe on [my blog](http://ihadthisideaonce.com)

This code is a fork of the original HiJackThis project, currently available at [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hjt/)
Please note that because I use this repository to experiment with refactoring it may not be suitable for the same 
uses as the original HiJackThis project.  If you are looking to use HiJackThis, I strongly reccomend that you get 
the code from its original source, on SourceForge.
